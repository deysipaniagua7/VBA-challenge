# VBA-challenge
This is the repository that holds my Module 2 VBA-challenge

Module Overview: Create a script that loops through 4 quarters' worth of data and output: a ticker, quarterly change from open-close of quarter, % change from open-close of quarter, and total stock volume. Moreover, we had to output the greastest % increase, greatest % decrease, and greatest total volume.

Please note that I requested/received help from 2 people through Slack's AskBCS Lerning Assistant and used the following resources:
